# FlappyBird

The flappy bird game components in Unity


When creating the project in Unity, create spawners to the right outer side of the screen and attach the pipe and ground spawner scripts. To the outer left of the screen, add a collector game object with a 2D box collider, make the box collider taller that it will be able to touch the grounds and pipes as they move to the left. Attach the collector script to it.

You can add any audio to the bird Audio Source to play a song as long as the player continues playing.

Enjoy :)
